# Lux-Mea-Business-Strategy-Consulting-Project
During my Master's program, I worked as a Business Strategy Consultant for LUX MEA LLC, an additive manufacturing company between September 2023 - December 2023. I conducted in-depth market research and data analysis to identify emerging industry trends and disruptive technologies. 
This project allowed me to apply my skills in business analysis, market research, strategic planning, and project management to address real-world challenges faced by the company.
Through extensive market research and data analysis, I uncovered emerging trends and disruptive technologies in the additive manufacturing landscape. Based on these insights, I developed comprehensive strategies to secure funding from government sources, establish partnerships with venture capitalists and private equity firms, and guide investment decisions towards high-growth opportunities. Additionally, I utilized project management tools like Jira and Confluence to align and integrate various project activities, ensuring effective collaboration and stakeholder communication throughout the project's lifecycle.
